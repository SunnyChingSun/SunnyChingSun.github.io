# Data Storytelling
*January 2026*

We often say "the data speaks for itself." It’s a comforting lie. It suggests that if we just collect enough rows and columns, truth will spontaneously emerge, immaculate and objective.

But data never speaks. It mumbles. It whispers confusing, contradictory things. It requires a translator. That translator is you.

## The Editorial Choice

Every visualization is an act of omission. When you choose a bar chart over a scatter plot, you are making an editorial decision. You are choosing to highlight *magnitude* over *distribution*. When you select a timeframe—say, the last 5 years instead of the last 50—you are framing the narrative.

> "A chart is not a mirror of reality. It is a lens."

Consider the famous "Flatten the Curve" charts from 2020. They didn't show exact case numbers. They didn't need to. Their purpose wasn't precision; it was *persuasion*. They told a story about capacity, time, and collective action using two simple humps.

## Finding the Signal

The hardest part of data storytelling isn't building the D3.js chart. It's finding the signal in the noise.

1.  **Exploration**: This is for you. Dive into the raw CSVs. Make 100 ugly charts. Find the outliers.
2.  **Explanation**: This is for them. Throw away 99 of those charts. Keep the one that matters.

Designers often confuse these two modes. We build dashboards that allow users to "explore everything," which usually means they discover nothing. A good data story guides the eye. It says: *Look here. Compare this to that. See this trend? Here is why it matters.*

## The Responsibility of the Narrator

With the power to frame reality comes a heavy ethical burden. A truncated y-axis can exaggerate a crisis. A cherry-picked correlation can imply causation where none exists.

We are not just analysts; we are narrators of the digital age. Our charts often travel further than our words. They end up in board decks, news feeds, and policy documents. They shape decisions.

So before you push "publish," ask yourself:
*   What story does this actually tell?
*   Is it the truth, or just a technically accurate lie?
*   Who is this story for, and what do I want them to feel?

Data doesn't speak. You do. Make sure you have something worth saying.
